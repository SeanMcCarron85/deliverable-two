/*
1- Prompt the user for the pet's name
2- Keep track of the pet's happiness and energy levels. Both start out at zero.
3- Use a loop to repeat the following six timesâ€¦
    1- Prompt the user for an action. They can type one of three options: feed, pet, or walk.
    2- The feed option increases energy by 2.
    3- The pet option increases happiness by 1
    4- The walk option increases happiness by 2 but decreases energy by 1.
4- If the user chooses "walk" but the energy level is currently at zero, do not increase happiness
or decrease energy. Instead, alert the following message: "Not enough energy to enjoy a
walk."
5- At the end, after the six actions, log the pet's name, happiness, and energy level to the
console.
